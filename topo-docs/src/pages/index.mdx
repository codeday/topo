# Welcome to Topo

Topo is CodeDay's design system. It was designed to let us really quickly build new websites and tools.

Topo is originally based on [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/getting-started). You may find it useful to cross-reference
their documentation for some components.

## Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms

The structure of Topo is based on [Brad Frost's Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/).
It's broken into three parts: Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms.

- **Atoms** are the smallest building blocks in Topo. They're not much more than combinations of Topo variables (colors,
padding, etc), and highly flexible. These are things like `Box`, `Image`, and `Spinner`.
- **Molecules** are moderately-flexible groups of Atoms which function as a unit. While Atoms are just combinations of
variables, building Molecules require some design skills. A modal window is one example of a Molecule.
- **Organisms** are macroscopic design patterns which are highly recognizable across our sites. Some examples are
headers, footers, and sponsor blocks. These aren't super flexible, but they let us create new sites quickly.

Pangram Pangram has a great diagram summarizing the difference:

Atomic design also includes two more levels: templates, and pages. Topo doesn't provide these, that's up to you!
