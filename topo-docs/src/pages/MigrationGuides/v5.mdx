# Updating to version 5
Topo version 5 introduced a breaking change for how imports are styled. Rather than importing each component from its own file, components are now sorted by category (`Atom`, `Molecule`, or `Organism`)

For example, to import a `Box`, previously you would do:
```js
import Box from '@codeday/topo/Atom/Box'
```
However, in every topo version >=5.0, you now do:
```js
import { Box } from '@codeday/topo/Atom'
```

To bulk-update most of the imports from a project using the old version of topo the new import structure, here are a few helpful regular expressions:

* Replace things like `import Box from '@codeday/topo/Atom/Box';` with `import { Box } from '@codeday/topo/Atom';`:
    - find: `import (.*) from '@codeday/topo/(Atom|Molecule|Organism)/(\1)';?`
    - replace: `import { $1 } from '@codeday/topo/$2';`

* Replace things like `import { Heading } from '@codeday/topo/Atom/Text';` with `import { Heading } from '@codeday/topo/Atom'`;
    - find: `import { ?(.*?) ?} from '@codeday/topo/(Atom|Molecule|Organism)/\w+';?`
    - replace: `import { $1 } from '@codeday/topo/$2';`

There are a few edge cases these expressions don't cover, notably things like `import Text, { Heading } from '@codeday/topo/Atom/Text';`

Find uncovered statements in need of manual review:

`import .* from '@codeday/topo/(Atom|Molecule|Organism)/`

It is still recommended to test all pages and components after executing these expressions, as there are bound to be edge cases in which these generic statements do not apply.
